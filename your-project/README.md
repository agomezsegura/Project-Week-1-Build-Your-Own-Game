## Project Description
*Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.*

This project is the first version I have programmed of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. I've chosen this game because it is very interactive with the player while having simple mechanics.

## Rules
*Briefly describe the rules of the game.*
Tic-Tac-Toe is a turn based game where two players aim to place three *marks* in a row. The board is formed by 9 cells where the players can assign their *marks* if the cell is empty. The game starts will all the cells *empty*, enabling the first player to assign a *mark* anywhere. After one player has ticked a square, it is the turn of the next player to assign his mark, until all the cells are full. If at any point in the game a player manages to place three *marks* in a row, the game finishes and that player wins the game. If the game ends when all the cells are *marked* the match is a draw.

## Workflow

## Organization
*How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?*
At the beginning of this project, the organization of the project was made with a kanban board with the tool *Trello*.

*What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.*
The repository of the project has the following folder structure:

- main folder named *'your-code'*: it contains all the subfolders and files of the project, including README.md
- subfolder named *'im&font'*: it contains all the images and fonts used in the project.
- file named *'main'*: it is the module that contains the general code of the game and that needs to be executed to run the game.
- file named *'play_vsCPU'*: it is the module that contains the code of a match between a player and the CPU.
- file named *'play_pvp'*: it is the module that contains the code of a match between a player and a player.
- file named *'game_board'*: it is the module that contains the code of the different used sprites in the game.
